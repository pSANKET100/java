				<h2>About us</h2>
				<br>
				<p>Dogs have been bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.[5] Dog breeds vary widely in shape, size, and color. They have the same number of bones (with the exception of the tail), powerful jaws that house around 42 teeth, and well-developed senses of smell, hearing, and sight. Compared to humans, dogs have an inferior visual acuity, a superior sense of smell, and a relatively large olfactory cortex.</p>
